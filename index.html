                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Oleg and I am current student in BYU Idaho (Applied Technologies(BS)). My first priority is to become a good professional in IT industry. 
                    Despite of the fact, that I don’t have a real work experience, the following personalities are my friends on that difficult and 
                    breathtaking adventure: I am stubborn, responsible, capable to learn, enthusiastic, and much more.</p>
                
                <h2>Programming languages and technologies</h2>
                <p>HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and a little bit of PHP and JAVA. Also there was an opportunity to work with pandas, os, and arcade libraries for Python.</p>

                <h2>Code Examples</h2>
                <h4>Code example. Count the divisors of a number. JS</h4>
                <code>function getDivisorsCnt(n){  
                    let i = 0;  
                    let matches = 0;  
                    for (i; i <= n; i++){  
                      if (n % i == 0){  
                        matches += 1;  
                      }  
                    }  
                    return (matches);  
                  }  </code>

                  <h4>Code example. Square numbers. Python</h4>

                  <code>
                    def square_digits(num):  
                    x = [int(a) for a in str(num)]
                    squared_nums = []
                    for i in x:
                        squared_num = i**2
                        squared_num = str(squared_num)
                        squared_nums.append(squared_num)
                    separator = ''
                    result = separator.join(squared_nums)
                    result = int(result)
                    return (result)
