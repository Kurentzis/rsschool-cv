            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Oleg and I am current student in BYU Idaho (Applied Technologies(BS)). My first
                priority is to become a good professional in IT industry.
                Despite of the fact, that I don’t have a real work experience, the following personalities are my
                friends on that difficult and
                breathtaking adventure: I am stubborn, responsible, capable to learn, enthusiastic, and much more.</p>

            <h2>Programming languages and technologies</h2>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and a little bit of PHP and JAVA. Also there was an opportunity to work with
                pandas, os, and arcade libraries for Python.</p>

            <h2>Code Examples</h2>

                    for (i; i <= n; i++){  
                      if (n % i == 0){  
                        matches += 1;
