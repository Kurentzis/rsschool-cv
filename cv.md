 **About me:** My first priority is to become a good professional in IT industry. Despite of the fact, that I don't have real work experience, the following personalities are my friends on that difficult and breathtaking adventure: I am stubborn, responsible, capable to learn, enthusiastic, and much more.

**Programming languages and technologies:** HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and a little bit of PHP and JAVA. Also there was an opportunity to work with pandas, os, and arcade libraries for Python.

**Code example. Count the divisors of a number. JS**

    function getDivisorsCnt(n){  
      let i = 0;  
      let matches = 0;  
      for (i; i <= n; i++){  
        if (n % i == 0){  
          matches += 1;  
        }  
      }  
      return (matches);  
    }  

**Code example. Count the divisors of a number. Python**

    def square_digits(num):  
        x = [int(a) for a in str(num)]
        squared_nums = []
        for i in x:
            squared_num = i**2
            squared_num = str(squared_num)
            squared_nums.append(squared_num)
        separator = ''
        result = separator.join(squared_nums)
        result = int(result)
        return (result)

**I am looking for my first job. I am a student in RS School**

*Except of RS SChool education I am  a student in BYU. That is a private university is USA. I am taking an online program in Applied Technologies(BS).
At this moment that's been 3 semesters and 5 classes after start, which is related to OOP, Front-end, and web engineering.*

*My English is approximately intermediate. Since I am a student in American school I have bunch of language practice*

**Here is the link to my biggest university project related to OOP and written on Python: https://github.com/Kurentzis/Asteroids.git *(You need to have arcade library installed to run that code)***
